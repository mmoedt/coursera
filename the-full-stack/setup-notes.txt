The setup instructions include:
(under "Working with labs and exercises in this course")

--
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi

pipenv shell
pipenv install
--

Note:  It doesn't mention that these need to be run in a terminal; adding to a script doesn't quite work right,
as the 'pipenv install' should be run inside the shell environment created by 'pipenv shell'.

Also, `cd /home/coder/project/YOUR_DJANGO_PROJECT` is pretty horrible!
I much prefer a directory like '/code/my-project-1'.  (I can set up /code as a mount point or a symlink to somewhere in my home folder if desired.  This is since I'm the owner of the machine and filesystem.. if I weren't, I could be running inside a docker container or similar and have access that way)


# A problem with the above setup is that it creates virtual environment files under your home directory.
I much prefer to keep things like the virtual environment, or any settings and other dependencies, next to the project.
You can set an env var like so:

export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1

So now .venv is created in the project dir, but it looks like virtualenv is still putting something in my home dir. (~/.local/share/virtualenv)
SO .. If we want a fix for this, a good solution may be simply to set up everything inside of a docker container...
